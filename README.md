## Main Features

* Native C++ - Miner installer/injector and watchdog now coded fully in C++ with no run requirements except a 64-bit OS
* Injection (Silent/Hidden) - Hide miner behind another process like conhost.exe, svchost.exe and others
* Idle Mining - Can be configured to mine at different CPU and GPU usages or not at all while computer is or isn't in use
* Stealth - Pauses the miner and clears the GPU memory while any of the programs in the "Stealth Targets" option are open
* Watchdog - Monitors the miner file and replaces the file if removed and starts it if the injected miner is closed down
* Multiple Miners - Can create multiple miners to run at the same time, for example one XMR (CPU) miner and one ETH (GPU) miner
* CPU & GPU Mining - Can mine on Both CPU and GPU (Nvidia & AMD)
* Windows Defender Exclusions - Can add exclusions into Windows Defender after being started to avoid being detected
* Process Killer - Constantly checks for any programs in the "Kill Targets" list and kills them if found
* Remote Configuration - Can get the miner settings remotely from a specified URL every 100 minutes
* Web Panel Support - Has support for monitoring and configuring all the miners efficiently in a free self-hosted online web panel


## Wiki

You can find the wiki [here](https://github.com/UnamSanctam/SilentCryptoMiner/wiki) or at the top of the page. The wiki contains information about the miner and all of its features, it also has some answers to frequently asked questions.

## Web Panel

You can find the web panel that the miner officially supports here: [UnamWebPanel](https://github.com/UnamSanctam/UnamWebPanel). The web panel can be used to monitor your miners hashrate, status, connection settings and more. It can also be used to change the miner settings just like how the option "Remote Configuration" does it.

## Changelog

* Rewrote much of the builder for the rewritten miner and watchdog
* Added custom C++ compiler package
* Added custom compiled version of SysWhispers2 to randomize syscalls seed on every build
* Changed default injection target to conhost.exe
* Removed injection target "explorer.exe" due to new protections and inconvenience
* Added new injection target "dwm.exe"
